# Squirrel Network Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing squirrel sightings in Central Park, based on data from the 2018 NYC Squirrel Census. The analysis focuses on network connections between sighting locations (hectare grids) and time shifts (AM/PM).

## Notebooks

- **`Squirrel_Count.ipynb`**: Cleans the dataset (handling missing values, normalizing text, formatting dates).
- **`squirrel_analysis.ipynb`**: Builds the network, calculates centrality measures, and visualizes squirrel activity.

## Data

- **Source**: 2018 NYC Squirrel Census
- **Includes**: Location, time, fur color, and interactions.
